### About

CreativeWallet is a web app and a new version of PersonalBudget app written in C++.

An application allows you to keep records of your expenses and incomes.
Data are saved to the database (MariaDB).

How does it work?

First create a user account, sign in and then you can add incomes and expenses with today's date or with a selected backdate.
You can show current month's balance, previous month's balance or selected period balance. The application calculates the sum of incomes, expenses and the difference between them (incomes - expenses).

Other functionalities:

- a tabular summary of the incomes and expenses (by category),
- a pie chart showing expenses from the selected period,
- add/edit/delete categories and payment methods,
- add monthly limit to expense categories,
- change password,
- delete account with related transactions.

### Framework

CreativeWallet consist of two components - application and custom framework. Application compoment has a specific code which is tightly coupled to project and it wouldn't work separately without making major adjustments. Framework component has a specific code but this code is portable and flexible.

This project also uses MVC design pattern which is responsible for splitting code (dividing responsibilities) into separate files (separation of concerns principle).

The MVC pattern is an acronym for Model-View-Controller:

- Model refers to the database logic,
- View refers to the HTML or template of a page,
- Controller refers to the logic for the page.

Framework component consists of several tools:

- Router
- Validator
- Database
- Template Engine
- Container

App class inside the framework component is like a glue for the available tools and utilizes every tools in our framework.
